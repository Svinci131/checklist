Is the script tag being attached?
	Appended as a script? 
	Response data coming back? 
	Cachebuster/query string on the moatad.js request?

Is it tracking the right element? 

if it’s timed out and can’t find an ad- if it creates ad we’re good(more code explanation in docs)
USE FIND_RELATIVE or TRACK PROXY


Are all IDs and keys coming in correctly on pixel fires?

Are all the keys present on the script in the DOM coming into all relevant keys on pixel fires?

i key: level0top. Will end in TEST1 if you're on staging.

d key: levels. 

(MUST have 4 values, separated by colons, even if those are empty. ::: is an acceptable key. foo:bar:test is not.)

bo/bp/bd keys: slicers. 

If there's only one slicer, it's bd. Two, bo/bd. Three, bo/bp/bd.

Any zMoat keys or client-specific keys. 

(Generally requires #define SEND_ALL_Z_IDS or INCLUDE_QS_PARAMS ["zMoatFoo"])cb=[MOAT_CB]

ak key: Screenshot URL. Only present on e=0 and e=25



Is it a Client issue? 

the first Micheal Kors thing where the google ad iframe and the add were siblings?


Are viewability events tracking correctly?

*Remember, only 30% viewability is needed for big ads for MRC viewable! Cutoff is 236425 pixels. (965x245)



—  Search 'Fired Pixel' in console: 

ag/gg: inview/fullview time

ce/gb: periscope inview/fullview time if present

ad/gk: safeframe/moatframe inview/fullview time if present

livperc: last in-view percentage



Are Mouse events tracking correctly?



e=1 pixels for non-iframe ad elements, 

e=22 for iframe ad elements

e=2 is mousedown

e=3 is click. 



In rare cases (flite ads): 

e=1 and e=22 due to proxy tracker interactions.
